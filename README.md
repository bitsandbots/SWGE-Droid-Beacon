# Star Wars Galaxys Edge: Droid Bluetooth Beacon
The droids built in SWGE Droid Depot at Disney Land and Disney World Hollywood Studios respond to BLE beacons placed throughout the park.

Use a low-cost nRF24L01 wireless transceiver connected to an Arduino Uno/Nano/Pro to transmit bluetooth droid location signals.
